# Documentation Generation Tool Specification

## Overview
This specification outlines the requirements and design for a documentation generation CLI tool that uses LangGraph to generate comprehensive documentation from codebases.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Input Handling
- Language-agnostic processing of code files
- Supports processing of individual files and directories
- Reads from local codebase/filesystem
- No restrictions on programming languages
- Handles both synchronous and asynchronous code patterns

### 2. Documentation Generation
- Generates Markdown-formatted documentation
- Includes code examples with consideration for future-proofing
- Automatically includes last updated date
- Supports cross-referencing between documentation sections
- Maintains semantic understanding of code relationships

### 3. Template System
- Supports custom documentation templates
- Allows customization of documentation formatting
- Template system should be extensible
- Default template should follow DeepWiki-style documentation

### 4. Future Considerations
- Potential for automatic change detection (future enhancement)
- No immediate requirement for table of contents/navigation structure
- Template system design should allow for future extensions

## Technical Requirements

### 1. CLI Interface
- Must be executable as a CLI tool
- Should support basic command-line arguments for:
  - Input file/directory path
  - Output directory
  - Template selection
  - Configuration options

### 2. Processing Pipeline
- File reading and parsing
- Code analysis and understanding
- Documentation generation using LangGraph
- Template application
- Output formatting

### 3. Output Structure
- Markdown files for documentation
- Maintains file/directory structure from input
- Includes metadata (last updated date)
- Supports cross-referencing via Markdown links

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Code Analysis
- Must handle different file types without language-specific parsing
- Focus on semantic understanding rather than syntax analysis
- Consideration for different code patterns and structures

### 2. Documentation Quality
- Balance between detail and maintainability
- Consideration for code example inclusion
- Proper handling of code references
- Clear and concise documentation generation

### 3. Performance
- Efficient file processing
- Scalable for large codebases
- Reasonable memory usage
- Optimized for CLI usage

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

1. Change Detection
   - File change monitoring
   - Incremental documentation updates
   - Version control integration

2. Advanced Features
   - Multi-format output support
   - Advanced template system
   - Documentation validation
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines

3. User Experience
   - Progress reporting
   - Error handling and reporting
   - Configuration management
   - Documentation preview capabilities

## Version Control
This specification is version 1.0. Future updates will be tracked in the document history.

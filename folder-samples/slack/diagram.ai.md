I need to analyze the explanation to create the Mermaid diagram, but it seems the explanation text is missing from your message. You mentioned it would be enclosed in <explanation> tags, but I don't see those tags or the explanation text in your message.

Could you please provide the detailed explanation of the design that should be enclosed in <explanation> tags?
